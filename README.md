# Generating Sense Embeddings

The included notebook utilizes code from the following sources:

- [LMMS](https://github.com/danlou/LMMS/tree/master)
- [Re-punctuate hugging face model](https://huggingface.co/SJ-Ray/Re-Punctuate)
- [TextGrids and utils](https://github.com/HuthLab/speechmodeltutorial/tree/master) from HuthLab's speech model tutorial

Additionally, vectors were downloaded from [this dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/LMMS-SP_ALBERT-XXLARGE/21975773?file=38999423) on figshare. Specifically, the file used is 'lmms-sp-wsd.albert-xxlarge-v2.vectors.txt'.
